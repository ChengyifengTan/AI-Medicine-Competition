    "qd":"[image]Task: You are an experienced medical imaging analysis expert. Based on the information provided below and the given [image_num] cervical spine MRI sagittal image, determine the physiological curvature status of the patient's cervical spine.\n Medical background information:Cervical physiological curvature refers to the natural forward curve (lordosis) of the cervical spine, typically C-shaped. The Cobb angle measurement method can be used to evaluate this curvature:\n - The Cobb angle is usually measured between the inferior endplates of C2 (axis) and C7 (seventh cervical vertebra).\n - On the sagittal MRI image, draw a horizontal line along the inferior endplate of C2 and another horizontal line along the inferior endplate of C7. The angle between these two lines is the Cobb angle.\n Classification based on Cobb angle:\n - Normal: Cobb angle between 17° and 27° (22°±5°) is considered normal.\n - Straightened: Cobb angle less than 17° indicates a straightened cervical curve, with loss of natural forward curvature.\n - Kyphosis: Cobb angle less than 0° (negative angle) indicates cervical kyphosis, where the spine curves backward abnormally.\n Output requirement: Based on your MRI analysis, output the classification label as follows:\n - Label 0: Normal (natural cervical lordosis, C-shaped curvature)\n - Label 1: Straightened (loss of cervical lordosis)\n - Label 2: Kyphosis (reversed cervical curvature)\n Only output the final classification label number:",
    "sl":"[image]Task: You are an experienced medical imaging expert. Please judge the alignment status of the cervical vertebrae of the patient based on the information below and the provided [image_num] cervical spine sagittal MRI images.\n Medical background information: Under normal conditions, the posterior edges of the cervical vertebrae should form a smooth curve on the sagittal MRI images. Step-like misalignments or discontinuities in the posterior edges may indicate vertebral alignment abnormalities such as dislocation or slippage.The anterior longitudinal ligament should appear as a continuous low-signal band closely attached to the anterior edge of the vertebrae on sagittal MRI images. Discontinuity or abnormal relationships between this ligament and the vertebral anterior edge may indicate alignment abnormalities.The C2-C7 SVA (sagittal vertical axis) is an important parameter for evaluating cervical sagittal balance. Normally, a small C2-C7 SVA value indicates good vertebral alignment. An increased value may indicate forward displacement or alignment abnormalities.The C2-C7 Cobb angle is used to evaluate the physiological curvature of the cervical spine. Although mainly used for curvature assessment, it can also provide reference information when judging vertebral alignment. Abnormal Cobb angles may be related to vertebral alignment issues.\n Output requirements: Based on your MRI analysis of the patient's cervical vertebral alignment, please select the classification that best fits from the two categories below and output the corresponding label number (0 or 1):\n - Label 0: Poor alignment (vertebrae are irregularly arranged, possible dislocation or slippage)\n - Label 1: Good alignment (vertebrae are basically normally arranged \n Output only the final classification label number:",
    "zjppt":"[image]Task: You are an experienced medical imaging expert. Please judge the condition of the [label] intervertebral disc based on the information below and the provided [image_num] cervical spine axial MRI images.\n Medical background information:Intervertebral discs are located between adjacent vertebral bodies. Under normal conditions, they appear elliptical or roughly square-shaped, with smooth edges and no obvious narrowing or bulging. When abnormalities occur, the following situations may be present:\n Bulging: The nucleus pulposus part of the disc expands but does not breach the annulus fibrosus. A bulging disc typically shows uniform high signal intensity, and the posterior disc edge may appear irregular;\n Protrusion: The nucleus pulposus partially breaks through the annulus fibrosus, forming a localized protrusion. The protruded area may present as a widened gap between the disc and vertebral body, and the protruding nucleus region shows high signal intensity;\n Extrusion: The nucleus pulposus completely separates from the annulus fibrosus, forming a free fragment. The extruded nucleus may be found within the spinal canal, contacting the dural sac or nerve roots.\n Output requirements: Based on your MRI analysis of the patient’s cervical spine, please select the classification that best fits from the following four categories and output the corresponding label number:\n - Label 0: Normal (no abnormalities in the disc)\n - Label 1: Bulging (the disc is slightly protruding outward overall, but the outer layer is intact)\n - Label 2: Protrusion (the outer layer is partially torn, and the internal material is locally bulging out)\n - Label 3: Extrusion (the outer layer is completely torn, and internal material may have escaped and displaced \n Output only the final classification label number.",
    "zyzg":"[image]Task: You are an experienced medical imaging expert. Based on the information below and the provided [image_num] axial cervical MRI images, please perform a graded assessment of the degree of central spinal canal stenosis at the [label] [object].\n Medical background information: The cervical spinal canal refers to the central part of the cervical vertebral canal, containing the spinal cord, cerebrospinal fluid, and surrounding dura mater. It is an important passage protecting the spinal cord and nerves. MRI can be used to evaluate stenosis of the cervical spinal canal:\n - Grade 0 (No stenosis): The central spinal canal appears spacious with no compression. On MRI images, clear spaces can be seen around the spinal cord, representing the normal subarachnoid space, appearing like a “gap” surrounding the spinal cord.\n - Grade 1 (Mild stenosis): The canal is narrowed, but the spinal cord itself remains undeformed. On MRI images, the subarachnoid space around the spinal cord is reduced by more than half, but the spinal cord looks normal without compression or deformation.\n - Grade 2 (Moderate stenosis): The canal is further narrowed, and the spinal cord begins to deform, but no internal injury is seen. On MRI images, the spinal cord is compressed or deformed, but the internal signal (color or brightness) of the spinal cord looks normal with no abnormal changes.\n - Grade 3 (Severe stenosis): The canal is severely narrowed, with the spinal cord deformed and showing internal injury. On MRI images, the spinal cord is severely compressed or deformed, and the internal signal changes (e.g., high signal intensity, usually bright), indicating injury or pathology inside the spinal cord.\n Output requirements: Based on your MRI analysis of the patient’s cervical vertebral canal, please select the classification that best fits from the following four categories and output the corresponding label number:\n - Label 0: Grade 0 (Normal spinal canal, no stenosis or compression)\n - Label 1: Grade 1 (Mild stenosis, spinal cord not obviously compressed)\n - Label 2: Grade 2 (Moderate stenosis, spinal cord compressed but no obvious signal change)\n - Label 3: Grade 3 (Severe stenosis, spinal cord obviously compressed with signal changes)\n Output only the final classification label number."
